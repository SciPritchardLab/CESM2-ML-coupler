1) login the way I normally do and launch interactive session and note its name and launch a jupyter notebook and make sure it has the right port.
2) Using tunnel syntax, shell into stampede2 login and from there shell into the interactive job with the tunnel syntax using `whoami`@its name (the purpose of this 2-link ssh chain is to allow the tunnel from 1) to laptop browser)
  tunnelstampede  (from laptop)
  ${TUNNEL}c455-032  (from stampede2)

nb the tunnel syntax is -L localhost:9142:localhost:9142

3) launch a browser and paste in the stuff from 1)
