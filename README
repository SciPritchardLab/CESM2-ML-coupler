Quickstart:
----------

I. INSTALL FKB. 

  git clone https://github.com/scientific-computing/FKB.git
  cd FKB
(Make sure to use same compiler version as used in CESM2 (for the machine you work on; check its module syntax in config_machines.xml to clarify), e.g. at stampede2:)
  module load intel/17.0.04
(edit build_steps.sh with the stampede2 wrapper:)  
  FC='mpif90 -qopenmp' cmake .. -DSERIAL=1
  sh build_steps.sh  
(this will install critical stuff in local FKB/build/lib and FKB/build/include --> take note of abs paths for use in II below)
  
II. Update CESM2 machine files to link FKB libraries and pre-compiled module files as follows:

Inside config_compilers.xml this might look like (see ***)

  <FFLAGS>
    <append> -xCOMMON-AVX512 -no-fma </append>
    <append MPILIB="mpi-serial"> -mcmodel medium </append>
***    <append> -I$ENV{HOME}/FKB/repositories/build/include </append>
</FFLAGS>
  <LDFLAGS>
    <append>-L$ENV{TACC_HDF5_LIB} -lhdf5 $(MKL) -zmuldefs -xCOMMON-AVX512</append>
***    <append>-L$ENV{HOME}/repositories/FKB/build/lib -lneural </append>
</LDFLAGS>

III.

Put source mods for the cam library in this directory.

WARNING: SourceMods are not kept under version control, and can easily
become out of date if changes are made to the source code on which they
are based. We only recommend using SourceMods for small, short-term
changes that just apply to one or two cases. For larger or longer-term
changes, including gradual, incremental changes towards a final
solution, we highly recommend making changes in the main source tree,
leveraging version control (git or svn).
