Quickstart:
----------

I. INSTALL FKB with same compiler version as used in CESM2 for the machine file you specify (check module syntax in config_machines.xml for your machine), e.g. at stampede2:

  git clone https://github.com/scientific-computing/FKB.git
  cd FKB
  module load intel/17.0.04
  FC='mpif90 -qopenmp' cmake .. -DSERIAL=1
  sh build_steps.sh
  
  (this will install critical stuff in local FKB/build/lib and FKB/build/include --> take note of abs paths for reuse in II below)
  
II. Update CESM2 machine files to link FKB libraries and pre-compiled module files as follows:




Put source mods for the cam library in this directory.

WARNING: SourceMods are not kept under version control, and can easily
become out of date if changes are made to the source code on which they
are based. We only recommend using SourceMods for small, short-term
changes that just apply to one or two cases. For larger or longer-term
changes, including gradual, incremental changes towards a final
solution, we highly recommend making changes in the main source tree,
leveraging version control (git or svn).
